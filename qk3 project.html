      <h1>ðŸŒº 90's Japanese CarsðŸŒº</h1>
    </div>
    <h2 class="summary">
      90â€™s Japanese cars are truly <b>wonderful!</b> They are designed to turn
      heads, to make you stop in your tracks and just watch as they go by. Not
      interested in blending in, Japanese designers created some of the most
      iconic cars ever produced between the late 80â€™s and early 90â€™s. These cars
      were not all just show, they could go! Produced with the driver in mind,
      some of these cars came equipped with industry leading technology from
      active rear steering to variable valve timing, to give the driver a truly
      track like experience whilst driving compared to the mundane grocery
      getters of the time. With incredible production line technology lowering
      manufacturing overheads, the everyday person could now get closer to that
      supercar experience which was previously unattainable. I will always have
      an appreciation for cars of this era. They are loud, they stand out and
      are unique which is something that seems to have been lost with modern
      vehicles which is why I spend my time restoring and modifying my 90â€™s
      Japanese project cars. When I get behind the wheel of one of these
      beautiful cars, I get a smile on my face every time.

      This is my 1996 Honda Del Sol. It is a naturally aspirated 1.6 litre SOHC.
      I picked this car up for Â£250 4 years ago. It was in rough shape with no
      paint, no exhaust, smashed headlight, broken roof mechanism, but a good
      healthy engine and remarkably rust free so Iâ€™ve spent this time restoring
      it to its former glory and going beyond with some modifications.
